This is a prototype implementation of a client
for discovery based APIs.

Installation
============

None. 

For the time being the required libraries
are checked into this directory to make 
developement easier, so you can just run
this directly after checking out.

Running
=======

First run three-legged-dance.py to get OAuth
tokens for Buzz, which will be stored in a file.

   $ python three-legged-dance.py

Then run sample.py, which will use the apiclient
library to retrieve the title of the most
recent entry in Buzz.

   $ python sample.py
