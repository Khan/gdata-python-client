"""Provides HTTP functions for gdata.service to use on Google App Engine

AppEngineHttpClient: Provides an HTTP request method which uses App Engine's
   urlfetch API. Set the http_client member of a GDataService object to an
   instance of an AppEngineHttpClient to allow the gdata library to run on
   Google App Engine.

run_on_appengine: Function which will modify an existing GDataService object
   to allow it to run on App Engine. It works by creating a new instance of
   the AppEngineHttpClient and replacing the GDataService object's
   http_client.
